# Smart-Parking-App---Android
It is an app which helps user to locate his/her car in a multi-story parking area

Every parking zone has a BLE device whose latitude and longitude information is stored in a central database server.
Depending upon that BLE's location, app will fetch the complete map of the floor from the same database and when user
wants to locate his/her car, app draws the complete floor map and points the position of their car on the map.
